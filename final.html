    <p>
        Pokémon[a][1][2][3] (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, 
        a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered 
        on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other 
        Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is 
        "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There are currently 901 Pokémon species.[7]

        The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for 
        the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media 
        mix franchise adapted into various different media.[8] Pokémon is estimated to be the highest-grossing media franchise of all time.
